## About The Project

This project shows off the work of importing Crowd Control into an already released Unity game. 

You can use this project as an example for how to incorporate Crowd Control into any other Unity based games.

### Prerequisites

Melon Loader (https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader)

Melon Loader Crowd Control Plugin (https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader)

Visual Studio 2017 or later

### Installation
Extract the project locally and open it with your preferred Visual Studio version, if newer than 2017 you may have to upgrade the solution
Install Melon Loader and the Crowd Control plugin to the Steam Cuphead directory, using the Mono version of the plugin

## Usage
After building, copy UI.dll to Cuphead\CrowdControl and TestEffectPack.dll to Cuphead\CrowdControl\Effects

The solution contains post build events to copy them automatically which may need to be retargetted.
